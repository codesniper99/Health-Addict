            The mission statements of <b>HealthAddicts </b>is as follows:
            <ol>
                <li> As we all know, addiction is a major problem that our Indian society faces. Be it in the form of <b>Alcholics, Drug abuse</b>, <b>Chain-smokers</b> or even <b>pornographic content addiction</b>.<br> While some of the people suffering from these problems are beyond recovery, there are still a few who have hope. These few are the people who need some extra motivation, inspiration or even professional advice to decrease or even quit their habits. <br>Our team aims to help these few lucky 'individuals' to become part of a 'group' that has the power to control their impulses. If given the chance, our team would strive to help the victims achieve a balance in their life.<br> <br><br>By installing our app, they have taken the first step on their own. All one needs is a guiding light. When the user wants to be alone, that is when they are most susceptible to giving in to thier old habits.<br> <br>Our application will give them their share of privacy and still be ineffective in helping them find their inner strength.<br> <br>We aim to bring professional psychiatrists to thier very phones. Help them track their progress as they become purer. Calculate certain key points pertaining to their quality of life by using Machine Learning Techniques. Provide them with motivational excerpts to help them start each day afresh.<br> <br>After our initial campaign ends successfully, we would follow up on our idea and bring it to production state.<br> <br>After launching it the feedback we would get over months would help shape a path to reaching the simplest and most complex of minds who succumb to such vices.<br><br> Truly this is achance to help many lives achieve what they want with the use of modern technology.
            </ol>
